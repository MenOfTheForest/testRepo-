# interview-intermediate to senior developer-1

Technical Interview - Challenge 1 for Intermediate and Senior Dev candidates

This application is written using .NET 6 and React and uses SQLite as the DB.
It is a badly-written program that does NOT follow best coding practices.

Your task is to improve this application in whichever ways you see fit,
i.e. you are allowed to introduce new nuget / npm libraries if you want.

Please ensure the application still works after the refactoring.

There are many issues that need fixing, but your time is also precious!
If you can think of any other improvements that you did not end up implementing, please let us know about them as well.

You don't need to send the application back to us, just make sure it's ready before the next interview.

In the next session, you will be asked to share your screen.
We will:

* discuss the improvements that you've made to the application
* ask you to implement a couple of new features in the application
* ask you several technical questions related to our tech stack (.NET, React, SQL)
